        Drawer Placement: You are using the placement=bottom for your mobile
        drawer, which makes it appear at the bottom of the screen. If you want
        it to appear from the left side, you can change the placement to
        placement=left. Header and Footer Content: Make sure that the header and
        footer content of your Drawer (mobile version) is properly structured
        and styled. You can use Chakra UI components like DrawerHeader and
        DrawerFooter for this purpose. Content Spacing: Adjust the spacing and
        positioning of your content elements to prevent overlap. Use Flexbox or
        Grid layout to control the positioning of your elements. Responsive
        Design: Ensure that your layout is responsive to different screen sizes.
        Use media queries to adjust styles for smaller scree
